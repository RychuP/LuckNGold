    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

  <data name="BlueFountainDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Water glows with a strange, cool #1blue #1light, casting dancing reflections on the drab walls and filling the space with a soft, ethereal illumination, its purpose shrouded in the quiet mystery of the room.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="BonesDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Scattering of #0bones lying on the floor, a grim testament to the dungeon's past. #0Skulls stare from empty sockets, while ribs, femurs, and vertebrae lie haphazardly mixed with scraps of rotting cloth and rusted armor.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="BoxesDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>A haphazard pile of #0small #0wooden #0boxes nestled against the stone walls. They are all different shapes and sizes, resembling a collection of oversized jewelry boxes or forgotten treasure chests. Some are bound with corroded metal and have intricate carvings, while others are plain and unadorned. A thick layer of dust covers the pile, but a few have been nudged out of place, leaving cleaner patches on the dirty stone floor.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="CandleDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>A lone #0candle flickers atop a wrought-iron stand, casting a small, dancing circle of amber light against the wall. The stand itself is not menacing, but functional. Wisps of smoke curl lazily from the flame, a tiny beacon of warmth and stability in the otherwise cool, still air.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="CandleStandDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>A rusted iron #0candle #0stand, tall and twisted like a skeletal limb, stands silent. A thick layer of congealed, black soot coats its surface, testimony to countless past burnt wicks. The stand is #1empty, save for a few flakes of ancient, dark wax stuck stubbornly to the top.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="CauldronDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>An oversized #0iron #0cauldron with a fire crackling merrily beneath it. The contents of the cauldron gurgle and spit in a rhythmic, soothing pattern. A gentle steam rises from the bubbling liquid, swirling lazily and disappearing into the low-lit ceiling.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="CratesDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>A stack of imposing, #0large #0wooden #0crates, their bulk casting deep shadows across the floor. The wood is thick and stained dark with age and moisture, and heavy iron straps, pitted with rust, secure their lids. They appear incredibly heavy and sturdy, as if meant to hold and protect valuable or dangerous cargo for a long journey. Some have a few broken or splintered planks, revealing nothing but darkness within.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FountainDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>An aged #0stone #0fountain, its basin filled with running water that gurgles and splashes softly. The craftsmanship is intricate, depicting ancient, weathered faces carved into the lip of the fountain. They seem to stare out with a quiet, knowing gaze, their features worn smooth by centuries of flowing water.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ClosedGateDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>A large #0gate of blackened iron, its heavy bars thick as a man's arm and twisted into complex, arcane patterns. The rust has eaten away at much of the surface, but where it remains, it speaks of a forgotten craftsmanship. There is no visible latch or handle, only a solid stone arch surrounding the rusted metal, suggesting that whatever #1mechanisms control the gate are either deep within the stone or long since removed.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="RedFountainDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Water glows with a strange, #1red #1light, casting dancing reflections on the drab walls and coloring the ancient faces in an eerie, unsettling hue. A forgotten story or ritual now only whispered by the endless, red-tinged flow.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ShacklesDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Rusting iron #0shackles hanging from a heavy iron ring set into the wall. A length of thick, corroded chain trails down from the cuff. The metal is rough and cold to the touch, and the clanking of the empty restraints echoes menacingly in the silence.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="SpiderWebDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Thick, gray sheets of #0web hanging from the walls, catching the dim light in a way that suggests a sinister shimmer. Some webs are ancient and dusty, like tattered curtains. Others are freshly spun, glistening with sticky dew and ominously strong.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="StepsDownDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>An opening in the floor revealing a crude, moss-covered #0staircase leading #1down. Narrow stone steps are cold and uneven, slick with centuries of grime and cold moisture. A rusted iron handrail offers only a dubious grip as the stairs wind lower into the darkness.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="StepsUpDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>A crumbling stone #0staircase leading #1upward. Light from some unknown source filters down from above revealing a sheen of dampness on the slick, cold stones. A rusted iron handrail, covered with a fine layer of grime, offers only a dubious grip as the stairs wind higher into the gloom.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="TorchDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>A pitch-soaked #0torch jammed into a heavy iron sconce mounted on the wall. It casts a flickering light that dances across the bricks. Long, dancing shadows twist and stretch like phantom figures. A thin plume of dark smoke curls upward, leaving a dark, greasy soot stain on the wall above it.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="UrnDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>A tall, #0stone #0urn, its surface worn smooth by the passage of centuries. Though it has the rounded body and flared pedestal of a ceremonial vessel, any ornate details have long since been scrubbed away by time and neglect. It is not merely a pot, but a sentinel to a story that has lost its voice.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="OpenGateDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Heavy, blackened bars pulled to the side and the deep grooves in the stone where the #0gate once slid. It did not #1retract completely. A jagged, broken section of the heavy iron bars remains jutting out from the opening, a rusted tooth in the mouth of the stone, a testimony to the violent force that tore it open.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="DoorDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>A thick, heavy #0oak #0door, bound with strips of corroded iron, stands stubbornly. The wood is scarred and splintered, evidence of countless attempts to break through it. The iron bindings, once polished, are now pitted with rust, and a simple, heavy iron ring hangs where a handle might be.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="DoorLockDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Across the iron bands, a massive, xxx #1padlock hangs, its shackle thick as a finger. It serves as a stark and silent barrier, leaving the imagination to wander to what, or who, it was meant to keep contained.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="BrownChestDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>A sturdy #0wooden #0chest, its once-smooth surface now rough and deeply scarred. Thick iron bands, corroded and dark with rust, wrap around its body, secured with heavy, round studs. </value>
  </data>
  <data name="EmptyChestDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The lid is slightly ajar, revealing a black, #1empty space within. It holds the scent of dust and the faintest memory of what might have once been inside.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FullChestDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The lid is slightly ajar, revealing a glimpse of the #1treasure within: an initial layer of tarnished coins, half-buried under dust, that only hints at the riches piled beneath. </value>
  </data>
  <data name="IronChestDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>A squat, heavy chest of blackened iron sits heavily in the shallow alcove, its very presence radiating a sense of unyielding permanence. Its surface is a mottled landscape of rust and corrosion, the result of long years in the damp air. </value>
  </data>
  <data name="AmberChestDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>A low, squat #0chest of polished, amber-hued metal sits in the shallow alcove, its surface reflecting the faint light with a deep, ornamental sheen. It is adorned with swirling, vine-like etchings, darkened with time and grime, that cover its surface in intricate patterns.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="LeverDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>A thick, #0heavy #0iron #0lever juts out from the cold floor, its surface rough with corrosion and age. It is set within a solid metal mount, bolted deep into the rock, giving it an appearance of immense strength and permanence. The handle is worn smooth in the center, as if from countless hands pulling it over the centuries. The heavy, unyielding feel of it in your hand and the quiet in the room tell of a potential, but forgotten purpose.</value>

  <data name="RubyBannerDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Rectangular symbol of deep #1ruby red at its heart remains oddly untouched by decay. It whispers of secrets that no longer have a voice and a story that has been obscured by time, leaving behind only the faintest, yet most captivating, trace.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="DiamondBannerDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>A stark symbol of pure #1diamond blue remains clear and untarnished. It is not bright or brilliant, but holds a soft, enduring glow, as if capturing all the faint light and holding it fast. </value>

  <data name="AmberBannerDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>A vibrant field of #1amber occupies the middle, its color suggesting something precious like solidified sunlight or ancient resin.</value>

    <value>Striking #1emerald color in the middle remains strangely vivid, its bright green a stark and captivating splash of life in the otherwise quiet and drab chamber. </value>

  <data name="BannerDescription" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>A #0banner of heavy cloth hangs on the wall. The fabric is worn and fraying at the edges, giving it the appearance of an ancient relic. The image at its center was once something significant, perhaps a symbol of rank, an elemental sigil, or a forgotten noble house. </value>
